# House Price Prediction – Regression Analysis

This repository focuses on predicting house prices using multiple regression models and comparing their performance on the same dataset. The project demonstrates a complete regression workflow, from data preparation to model evaluation, following correct machine learning practices.

## Project Overview

* **Dataset:** Structured housing dataset with numerical features describing property characteristics
* **Objective:** Predict house prices and evaluate how different regression models perform on the task
* **Tools:** Python, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## Models Used

* **Linear Regression** – Baseline model for understanding linear relationships and feature impact
* **Support Vector Regression (SVR)** – Captures non-linear patterns with kernel-based learning
* **Random Forest Regressor** – Ensemble, tree-based model for robust non-linear prediction

## Evaluation Metrics

Model performance is assessed using standard regression metrics:

* Mean Squared Error (MSE)
* Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
* Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
* Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
* R² Score
* Adjusted R² Score

## Key Highlights

* Proper train–test split
* Feature scaling applied only where required (Linear Regression, SVR)
* Residual-based error analysis
* Fair comparison of multiple regression models using consistent metrics

## Purpose

This project is intended for **learning applied regression**, **machine learning interview preparation**, and **portfolio demonstration**, showcasing model comparison, metric interpretation, and clean analytical workflow.
